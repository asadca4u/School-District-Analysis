# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
### A district school board has asked us to run the following set of analyses on data collected from 15 schools in the district
1. An overall summary of the district, including the budget of its 15 schools, the total amount of students, their average reading and math scores, as well as the proportion that are passing reading and math as well as both overall. 
2. The analysis in step 1 is to be separated based on each school.
3. This analysis is to be used to determine the top 5 performing schools, as well as the bottom 5 performing schools.
4. The data is to be further sectioned off by grade for each school, in order to determine the average math and reading score by grade at each school.
5. Next, the schools are to be sectioned off into ranges based on their average spending per student, as well as the size of the school, in order to determine how student body size and avrage spending per student affect the average scores for math and reading. 
6. Finally, the schools are sectioned off into District or Charter schools in order to determine if the type of school and all that it entails, has any meaningful effect on average math and reading scores.
